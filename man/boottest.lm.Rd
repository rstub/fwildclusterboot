\usage{
\method{boottest}{lm}(
  object,
  clustid,
  param,
  B,
  weights = NULL,
  conf_int = NULL,
  seed = NULL,
  beta0 = NULL,
  alpha = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class lm}

\item{clustid}{A vector with the clusters}

\item{param}{The univariate coefficients for which a hypothesis is to be tested}

\item{B}{number of bootstrap iterations}

\item{weights}{Regression weights. Currently, WLS is not supported, and weights needs to be NULL}

\item{conf_int}{A logical vector. If TRUE, boottest computes confidence intervals by p-value inversion}

\item{seed}{An integer. Allows the user to set a random seed}

\item{beta0}{A numeric. Shifts the null hypothesis}

\item{alpha}{A numeric between 0 and 1. Sets to confidence level: alpha = 0.05 returns 0.95\% confidence intervals}
}
\value{
An object of class boottest
}
