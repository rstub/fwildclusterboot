Description: Implementation of the fast algorithm for wild cluster bootstrap 
             inference developed in Roodman et al (2019, STATA Journal) for 
             linear regression models 
             <doi:10.1177/1536867X19830877>, 
             which makes it feasible to quickly calculate bootstrap test 
             statistics based on a large number of bootstrap draws even for 
             large samples - as long as the number of bootstrapping clusters 
             is not too large. Multiway clustering, regression weights, 
             bootstrap weights, fixed effects and subcluster bootstrapping
             are supported. Further, both restricted (WCR) and unrestricted
             (WCU) bootstrap are supported. Methods are provided for a variety 
             of fitted models, including 'lm()', 'feols()' 
             (from package 'fixest') and 'felm()' (from package 'lfe').
             Further, R port to WildBootTests.jl, which provides the wild cluster 
             bootstrap for OLS, IV and hypotheses with q > 1.
