Description: Implementation of fast algorithms for wild cluster
    bootstrap inference developed in 'Roodman et al' (2019, 'STATA'
    Journal, <doi:10.1177/1536867X19830877>) and 'MacKinnon et al' (2022),
    which makes it feasible to quickly calculate bootstrap test statistics
    based on a large number of bootstrap draws even for large samples.
    Multiple bootstrap types as described in 'MacKinnon, Nielsen & Webb'
    (2022) are supported.  Further, 'multiway' clustering, regression
    weights, bootstrap weights, fixed effects and 'subcluster'
    bootstrapping are supported. Further, both restricted ('WCR') and
    unrestricted ('WCU') bootstrap are supported. Methods are provided for
    a variety of fitted models, including 'lm()', 'feols()' (from package
    'fixest') and 'felm()' (from package 'lfe').  Additionally implements
    a 'heteroskedasticity-robust' ('HC1') wild bootstrap.  Last, the
    package provides an R binding to 'WildBootTests.jl', which provides
    additional speed gains and functionality, including the 'WRE'
    bootstrap for instrumental variable models (based on models of type
    'ivreg()' from package 'ivreg') and hypotheses with q > 1.
